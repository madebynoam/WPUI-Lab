Three Strategic Approaches

Option A: AI Agent Evolution (Recommended)

Make the AI a true design partner, not just a command executor. This is your biggest differentiator vs Figma.

- Agent learns from context: Understands your project's existing patterns, colors, and naming conventions
- Iterative refinement: "Make it more like the Jetpack dashboard" → agent finds reference, adapts
- Multi-step reasoning: Agent can discover what's wrong, propose fixes, and execute
- Design-aware suggestions: "This looks cramped, want me to add spacing?"

Why I recommend this: No one else has this. Figma has AI features but they're add-ons, not core. Your AI could be the primary design interface.

Option B: Layout Model Fix + Full-bleed Support

Fix the foundational layout issue so designers can create real dashboard layouts.

- Full-width sections: Hero/navbar that breaks page padding
- Sticky positioning: Fixed headers, floating action buttons
- Viewport-relative sizing: vh/vw units for modern layouts
- Z-index/layering: Overlays, modals, dropdowns

Why consider this: Blocking issue - without it, designers hit walls quickly.

Option C: Component/Pattern Library Expansion

Build out the building blocks to reduce friction.

- Charts/data viz: Line, bar, pie charts (common in dashboards)
- Images/media: Image component, avatars, thumbnails
- Pre-built patterns: Jetpack-style stat cards, WooCommerce-style tables
- Team patterns: Let users save custom patterns to reuse

Why consider this: More immediate payoff for users - they can build what they need faster.
